# Why RPM ?

Well, this RPM (SMPEG) can be harsh to drop on Fedora because it's not on base repo and not on rpm-fusion but an another repo that I can't add so I just put it here.

It can be usefull if you want a not static ONScripter-EN on Federo or RPM-based distro.

# HOWTO

```bash
sudo rpm install s_smpeg-0.4.5-27.1.x86_64.rpm
sudo rpm install s_smpeg-devel-0.4.5-27.1.x86_64.rpm
```
